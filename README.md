# C-Sharp-LiveProject-TheatreWebsite
 
Thank you for checking this code summary out! It details the types of problems I encountered in the Live Project and how I managed to work past them.  This is the second and last live project that I've worked on while with The Tech Academy, and I can say that this project was one that I enjoyed most! Working with a team really helped myself understand that the entire process is a team effort, something that was lacking in the first project where we used the Django framework to create a web application of our own choosing. While making our own applications were fun, the problem solving in this second project made me enjoy the process even more.

Below you will find the story cards I was assigned to, and the code snippets I worked on during this two week live project! 


#### About the Project

To start, here is the overview we were given at the start of our project:

![Theatre CMS Overview](../../../../../../../c:/Users/dell/Pictures/code%20snippets/StoryCards/TheatreCMSOverview.png)

Our roles as developers were to collaborate on a website for a local theater/acting company, making it easy to use for users who don't have much experience with technology. As such, it is considered a content management service that is built using ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework.

My role specifically was to work on the Cast Member list over the course of a few stories, which are detailed below...

### Story 1: Create Entity Model for CastMember and CRUD Pages



### Story 2

### Story 3

### Story 4 and Beyond...
